## WExT (WNC Expungement Tool)
Based on the excellent work of [Code for Durham](https://codefordurham.com/) and the [DEAR Durham project](https://www.deardurham.org/), Code for Asheville is working with [Pisgah Legal Services](https://www.pisgahlegal.org/) to make record expungement faster and easier for folks in the region by automating the generation of petitions for expungement. We could use some help from folks with Django or React skills.

To connect and get involved, join the `#record_expungement` channel in our [Slack workspace](https://codeforasheville.slack.com).

## YMI Cultural Center
Workforce development is one of the initiatives of the YMI Cultural Center, and the YMI would like to add a job board to their [website](https://www.ymiculturalcenter.org/).  
In addition, the YMI would like to add a dedicated workforce development page to their website, which would link to the job board and to relevant resources for employers and job seekers.

To connect and get involved, join the `#ymi_job_board` in our [Slack workspace](https://codeforasheville.slack.com).

## Court Notifications
To help ensure that folks don't miss court dates, the State of North Carolina created a court date notification system. However, this system is not integrated with a case number lookup tool, which is available in a completely different system. The goal of this project is to streamline the look-up and sign-up process to the extent possible, without building a whole new, parallel system. We could use some help from someone with React skills.

To connect and get involved, join the `#court_notifications` channel in our [Slack workspace](https://codeforasheville.slack.com).
