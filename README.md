## WExT (WNC Expungement Tool)
Based on the excellent work of [Code for Durham](https://codefordurham.com/) and the [DEAR Durham project](https://www.deardurham.org/), Code for Asheville is working with [Pisgah Legal Services](https://www.pisgahlegal.org/) to make record expungement faster and easier for folks in the region by automating the generation of petitions for expungement.

## YMI Cultural Center
Workforce development is one of the initiatives of the YMI Cultural Center, and the YMI would like to add a job board to their [website](https://www.ymiculturalcenter.org/).  
In addition, the YMI would like to add a dedicated workforce development page to their website, which would link to the job board and to relevant resources for employers and job seekers.

## Court Notifications
To help ensure that folks don't miss court dates, the State of North Carolina created a court date notification system. However, this system is not integrated with a case number lookup tool, which is available in a completely different system. The goal of this project is to streamline the look-up and sign-up process to the extent possible, without building a whole new, parallel system.

To connect and get involved, join the `#court_notifications` channel in our [Slack workspace](https://codeforasheville.slack.com).
